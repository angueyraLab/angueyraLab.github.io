In 2024, during the 10<sup>th</sup> Strategic Conference of Zebrafish Investigators, after Judith Eisen's talk, we &mdash;[Kristen Kwan](https://www.kwan-lab.org/), [Jamie Gagnon](https://www.gagnonlab.org/) and Juan Angueyra&mdash; realized that some of the history of zebrafish research needs to be kept for future generations. As a small part in this effort, the people from neuroTree (shout out to [Stephen David](https://www.ohsu.edu/people/stephen-v-david-phd)) helped us setup [danioTree](https://academictree.org/danio), as a way to trace the scientific lineages of our field.
