<h1 class="text-center">Visual System Development <br> Angueyra Lab</h1>

<p class="lead text-justify">
Our laboratory strives to be a cooperative, diverse and curious research group.<br/>
We are generally interested in the development of the eye and the visual system.<br/>
In particular, we are interested in how the cells and circuits in the retina are built during development.<br/>
We mainly use zebrafish as a model system that allows us to study this process in vivo and to create genetic manipulations, but our collaborations expand our research further.<br/>
<b>Interested in joining us? [Follow this link](https://angueyralab.github.io/JoinUs/)</b><br/>
Our lab is located at University of Maryland, College Park, in the [Department of Biology](https://biology.umd.edu/) and the [Brain and Behavior Institute](https://bbi.umd.edu/) <br/>
