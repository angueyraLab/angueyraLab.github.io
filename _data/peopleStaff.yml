  bio: "I was born in Colombia. An early exposure to a lot of fly bits and a rich biodiversity stirred a deep-seated passion for the biological sciences. During my undergraduate studies at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, I used electrophysiology to study the phototrasduction pathway in the understudied eye of Planaria, a small and primitive flatworm. Now I aim to understand retinal development in zebrafish, using in vivo imaging."
