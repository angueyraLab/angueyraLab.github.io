  bio: "I am interested in how retinal circuits are built and designed, to be able to use information relayed by photoreceptors and, to support vision.<br >I have studied photoreceptors in many species including scallop and amphioxus (with Enrico Nasi and Maria Gomez at the MBL in Woods Hole), primate and mouse (with Fred Rieke at UW in Seattle), squirrel and zebrafish (with Wei Li and Katie Kindt at NIH), and hope to keep this list growing."
