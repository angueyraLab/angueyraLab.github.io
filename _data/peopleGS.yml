  bio: "I earned my bachelors degree in Biology from Roanoke College in 2021. In undergrad, I studied how light conditons influence monolignol synthesis in the Arabidopsis thaliana. I became fascinated by how the environment influences epigenetic networks of genes and further pursued this at UMD. In the Visual System Development lab, I am interested in exploring how transcription factors infuence the generation of the final cellular identity of photoreceptors in the developing retina."
