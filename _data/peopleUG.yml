  bio: "I am a second year undergraduate student at University of Maryland, College park, pursuing a double degree in biological sciences with a concentration in neurobiology and physiology as well as psychology. I am also in the integrated life sciences honors college and will be pursuing the biological science honors thesis. During my time at the Visual System Development lab I hope to explore the connection between different transcription factors and their mutant phenotypes and expand my knowledge how genetics impact disease."

  bio: "I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Maryland, College Park majoring in General Biology. As a peer research mentor in the FIRE CellEx program, I have spent the past two years studying ribosome biogenesis. At the Visual System Development Lab, I am excited to explore the transcription factors underlying the development and differentiation of horizontal cells in zebrafish, as well as how synaptic connectivity may influence the cell fate of photoreceptors."

  bio: "I am an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland, College Park majoring in the biological sciences with a concentration in neurobiology and physiology as well as a member in the Gemstone Honors program. I am interested in exploring how the fundamental components of biological processes are correlated and synergize with one another to sustain living systems. I believe that this is the first step in working towards further investigating complex issues such as biological disorders that impact many lives today."
