  bio: "I am a current undergraduate student studying neuroscience at the University of Maryland, set to graduate in the Spring of 2025. I have recently been studying horizontal cells in the retina of zebrafish at the Angueyra lab, specifically how synaptic connectivity influences the cell fate of photoreceptors.  During my time at the Visual System Development lab, I am excited to explore how different transgenic lines vary in cellular development in the retina."

  bio: "I am an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland, College Park majoring in the biological sciences with a concentration in neurobiology and physiology as well as a member in the Gemstone Honors program. I am interested in exploring how the fundamental components of biological processes are correlated and synergize with one another to sustain living systems. I believe that this is the first step in working towards further investigating complex issues such as biological disorders that impact many lives today."
